Tsoro Yematatu is a two-player abstract strategy game from Zimbabwe. Players first drop their three pieces onto the board, 
and then move them to create a 3 in-a-row which wins the game. What makes this game unique is that pieces can jump over 
each other (without capture) which adds an extra dimension in the maneuverability of the pieces.

This project was built in Java using Sockets and RMI.
